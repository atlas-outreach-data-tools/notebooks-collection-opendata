    "* [graphviz](https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/) provides cool visualization interfaces for the events\n",

    "For the last section of this notebook, we'll use a parametric detector simulation called [Delphes](http://delphes.github.io). It's commonly used for phenomenology studies, and has a lot of nice features that we'll only just touch here, but you should feel free to explore further on your own!\n",

    "As you'll see in the log, it may be that you need to restart the kernel after installing these packages for the first time in order to get everything in working order. In case you encounter some odd error (cannot import a module, or cannot find a package) later in this notebook, try restarting the kernel to see if that solves your issue."

It's usually safest to look at the stable particles (with `status=1`), because those are the particles that the generator believes will enter the detector. They are what we refer to as \"observable\". Often when trying to look into things that are not observable (e.g. particles with other status codes), the answer becomes dependent on the implementation of the event generator, or what the event generator authors chose to write into the HEPMC record — and of course, nature can't depend on what an event generator author decided to do!\n",

We'll plot the number of leptons, and the largest transverse momentum from the leptons (also known as the \"leading\" lepton transverse momentum, or leading lepton $p_{T}$). Top quark decays produce a W boson that can decay to a lepton and neutrino or quarks. Since we have four top quarks, we can get anywhere from zero to four leptons from the W bosons. Top quarks also make b quarks, which sometimes include leptons in their decays as well, so we'll make our plot all the way out to five leptons.\n",

    "## Detector Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do some simple detector simulation using [Delphes](https://github.com/delphes/delphes) as well. Delphes is a pretty standard parametric detector simulation package used widely in the phenomenology community. Delphes offers some command-line executables that can be used. We will run one of the pre-defined analyses as an example. Of course, more complicated usage is possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a fair bit of magic in the next line. First, we're using `%%bash` magic in jupyter to let us run a command like we had a terminal with a `bash` shell. Delphes doesn't have a python interface, so we have to use it like an executable. Notice that we are passing the HEPMC file name through the bash magic here. The actual executable we are running is called `DelphesHepMC2`. Since these open event generation files are in `HepMC2` text format, that's the right executable to use. We access the \"cards\", which are for configuration, using the environment variable `${CONDA_PREFIX}`. That's where they all get installed, because we used conda up at the top of this notebook to install Delphes. There are a [lot of cards](https://github.com/delphes/delphes/tree/master/cards) available; here we're using the default ATLAS card. The next two arguments are the output file name (`delphes_output.root`) and the input file name (`$1` refers back to the HEPMC file name that we passed via the bash magic)."
