    "# How to rediscover the Higgs boson yourself - with the coffea framework!\n",
    "This notebook uses ATLAS Open Data http://opendata.atlas.cern to show you the steps to rediscover the Higgs boson yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "ATLAS Open Data provides open access to proton-proton collision data at the LHC for educational purposes. ATLAS Open Data resources are ideal for high-school, undergraduate and postgraduate students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are web applications that allow you to create and share documents that can contain for example:\n",
    "1. live code\n",
    "2. visualisations\n",
    "3. narrative text\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on [HZZAnalysis.ipynb](https://github.com/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata/blob/master/13-TeV-examples/uproot_python/HZZAnalysis.ipynb) in the same folder as this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the coffea Python package, which combines many features useful for the manipulation and analysis of data from high-energy physics experiments. This package also allows for the use of parallel computing technologies such as Dask to speed up the processing of data and easily scale the analysis for computing clusters and super-computers. It uses a feature called processors where a user specifies the analysis they want and then coffea handles the parallelization for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coffea framework is a prototype currently in development in collaboration with IRIS-HEP. This notebook was created as part of an [IRIS-HEP fellowship project](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/stormsomething.html), and a repository containing all the code and notes created for that project can be found [here](https://github.com/stormsomething/CoffeaHZZAnalysis). You can find out more about coffea [here](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea), and you can find out more about IRIS-HEP [here](https://iris-hep.org/).\n",
