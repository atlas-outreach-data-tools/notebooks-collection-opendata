    "Some numerical statements are exact, such as the number of books on your desk or the number of siblings you have. However, all *measurements*, no matter how carefully they are taken, have some degree of uncertainty that can come from a variety of sources. The process of evaluating uncertainties and identifying sources of error is called **error analysis**. The goal of error analysis is to properly estimate uncertainities in measurements and try to reduce them as much as possible. "

The first physicist, named Shawn, reports his best estimate of the mass to be $m_\\text{shawn} = 131$ GeV and says that is almost certaintly lies between 124 and 138 GeV.

    "* **Uncertainties of Measurements.** The uncertainty of Shawn's measurement is so large that his results are pretty much useless. The mass of the predicted new particle and of the Higgs boson lie within his range, so it is possible that Shawn may have actually found a Higgs boson and not a new particle. We cannot make a valid conclusion using Shawn's measurement. However, Danielle's measurement indicate clearly that she found a Higgs boson; the mass of the Higgs boson lies within her range, while the mass of the predicted new particle lies far outside it.\n",

Ignoring systematic uncertainties can lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions.\n",

This means that for a physics process with a cross section of 1 fb (one femtobarn), we would expect to see 3.24 events in the 2015 data, and 33.4 events in the 2016 data. The exact number of proton collisions is known with an uncertainity of about 1%, which is the most precise uncertainty on the luminosity at a hadron collider to date (see [this page](\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09379\") for more information.)\n",

    "* **Scale Factor Uncertainties.** These arise when the real data and simulation differ in some regard. For example, perhaps in real data an electron is correctly identified 85% of the time, and in simulation it is only correctly identified 83% of the time. A scale factor is applied to the simulation to correct it to match the data, and the uncertainties on that scale factor are included as systematic uncertainties in an analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Calibration Uncertainties.** These arise when, for example, the momentum of a physics object must be calculated from measurements in the detector. For example, the momentum of a jet is calculated from measurements of charged particles in the inner detector and measurements of energy deposits in the calorimeter, among other things. These individual measurements all have uncertainties, and there are additional uncertainties in the way they are combined to produce a final momentum. All those uncertainties need to be included in an analysis.\n",
