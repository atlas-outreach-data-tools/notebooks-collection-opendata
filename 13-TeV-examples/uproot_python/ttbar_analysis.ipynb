        "In the study of top-antitop quark pair production ($t\\bar{t}$), accurately reconstructing the masses of the decayed particles is essential for identifying the signal and distinguishing it from background processes. The top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle, typically decays into a W boson and a b-quark. In semileptonic $t\\bar{t}$ decays, one W boson decays into a lepton and a neutrino, while the other W boson decays hadronically into jets.\n",

This process involves complex calculations that take into account the momentum, energy, and spatial distributions of the leptons, neutrinos, and jets involved in the decay.\n",

These two solutions lead to two potential values for the top quark mass. To account for both possibilities in the analysis, we combine these two mass values into a single list.
