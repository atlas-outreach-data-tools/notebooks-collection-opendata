    "\n",
    "Dark Matter is a hypothesised type of matter that does not interact with the electromagnetic force. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible. So how has it been hypothesised? During various observations, astrophysicists have found that there isn't enough matter in space to account for all the gravitational attractions we measure! Therefore, there must be some invisible matter interacting with visible matter through Gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at one example quickly: gravitational lensing. It is when light gets bent around objects in space due to the gravitational fields around massive bodies. This lets you see behind objects in space!\n",

    "\n",
    "We see that mass has an effect on the path that light travels, so how does this relate to dark matter? Astrophysicists have seen light from distant objects that have been gravitationally lensed 'too much' - with the amount of observable mass causing the lensing, they should not see some objects that they in fact do! This then implies that there must be some more mass there that we can't see - dark matter!\n",

    "\n",
    "So if dark matter is so common across the universe and its effects are clearly observed by astrophysicists, it should be easy to create and observe it using the ATLAS detector, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, not. Because we can't directly observe dark matter, there are many hypotheses of what it actually is. One hypothesis, or model, that we will be searching for is called a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can guess from the name, this type of dark matter particle is hard to detect because it doesn't really interact with other things. For example WIMPs don't interact with electromagnetic radiation, including light. Hence, we can't see them!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can we do to detect dark matter? Well if we can't see the dark matter around us, let's make the dark matter ourselves and see what happens!\n",
    "\n",
    "At the LHC we collide particles together and look at new particles that are created from these collisions. What we can do is collide protons and look to see if any of those collisions produce dark matter particles! In the next section, we'll specifically look at the hypothesised process that creates dark matter.\n",

    "Neural networks (NN) are not your typical computer program. They are part of a broad group of algorithms that use Machine Learning (ML). While the conventional idea of a computer program is a precise set of instructions for a computer to follow, Machine Learning allows the computer to achieve goals it was not specifically instructed to perform. From a general set of principles, ML grants computers a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more formal definition of a Machine Learning algorithm is something along the lines of: a program for automated analytical modelling. Let’s dissect each term of this description using neural networks as an example. At first, the network takes a set of inputs from a dataset we want to know more about (analytical). It then makes decisions to optimize its success in analysing these inputs (automated). Finally, it gives an output that highlights patterns found in the dataset (modelling). The type of data the neural network receives and its structure are defined by the programmer, you. But once all parameters are set, the program will perform tasks without requiring explicit, line by line, instructions on how to do them!\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, we are going to focus on neural networks for this workbook since it is one of the most widely used computational techniques. In essence, NNs can be understood as functions. Just like *y=ax+b*, they require an input (*x*) to interact with some *inner parameters* (*a* and *b*) so that an output (*y*) can be produced. In this sense, neural networks attempt to solve a specific task by modelling a function that may or not be similar to a conventional computer program that was instructed to solve the same thing. The reality is that neural networks can have up to several thousands of inner parameters, making things more complex. Although a slightly more in-depth discussion of this matter can be found in the section “[The Universality Theorem](#universality)”, let’s stick to an analogy for now.\n",

    "In this section, we will use a thought experiment to understand the structure and functioning of neural networks. To break the silence, a group of friends decide to play a certain game. The goal of this game is to accurately identify images of cats and dogs. We shall refer to these two categories as classes because they can  be distinguished upon evaluating their characteristics. Each individual characteristic such as number of paws or weight is referred to as a descriptor since it describes the animal. To make the game challenging, no player can single-handedly guess the class. Instead, the players have to form some sort of assembly line that begins with raw materials (descriptors) and ends with a product (classification). Also similarly, each player can only receive information from their previous neighbor and send information to their next neighbor. For a group of four friends, the network structure might look something like the diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Single Input NN Diagram](images/Dark_Matter/single_NN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Amongst many approaches to this game, the friends decide to transform the descriptors from Friend 1 into a sentence that Friend 4 will easily be able to interpret as either a cat or a dog. Following the assembly line: Friend 1 looks at an image and notes down a characteristic of the animal; Friend 2 gets the descriptor and converts it into an adjective; Friend 3 receives the adjective and writes a description from it; Friend 4 then finally reads the description and yells the class of the animal. If Friend 1 verifies that Friend 4 is correct, they won the game. Else, they lost the round. Therefore, the success of the goal depends on the independent reasoning of each neuron as well as collaboration via a collection of processed information. With the plan set, the group of friends decide to give it a try, here using “height” as the descriptor (see diagram below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cat Single NN Diagram](images/Dark_Matter/cat_single_NN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can observe, Friend 4 had no clue whether the animal was a cat or a dog. For all Friend 4 is concerned, deciding between a cat or a dog is a fifty-fifty probability scenario akin to tossing a coin to give an answer. The issue lies in the fact that both animals share common features such as having four legs, whiskers, and tails. In the previous round, a short animal could be both a normal-sized cat or a small-sized dog like a Welsh Corgi or a Chihuahua. Hence, it becomes hard to distinguish between them with only one descriptor. For this reason, a better approach is to increase the number of initial friends, or inputs, we have in our game to something like the diagram below. Notice how we now have a layer of friends to perform the same task, in this case, to evaluate one descriptor each.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Multi-input NN Diagram](images/Dark_Matter/multi_NN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In more technical terms, each friend represents a neuron of a neural network. The design and functioning of these neurons were inspired by biological neurons but should not be treated as such. Complementing the discussion in the previous section, the neurons are the ones that hold the inner parameters of a network. Any optimization then requires the tweaking of these individual parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our thought-experiment, the group of friends decides to call two more players to the game. By forming a layer with Friend 1, these two extra friends will allow the group to input two more descriptors. In the upcoming diagrams, the group decides to use the following inputs: height as Input A; whisker length as Input B, and fur pattern as Input C. Each friend in Friend Layer 1 can only evaluate one descriptor from the image. While each friend still performs the same tasks, the group hopes to get better results this time. Two example outcomes can be seen in the diagrams below.\n",

    "Gladly, we see Friend 4 outputs the correct classification of the image even though only Friend Layer 1 had access to the original image. Most importantly, there is an increasing degree of pattern recognition along the network of friends that allows each friend to perform optimally to accurately classify cats and dogs.\n",

But what are the advantages of using neural networks instead of having a human do the analysis? Unfortunately, the answer is not that straight-forward. Yet, two arguments give a significant advantage to neural networks.\n",

    "In contrast with our thought-experiments, real-life resources are scarce and we must take them into consideration when analysing data. For any task performed, *computational resources* are needed. Anything from electricity, hardware, to time spent between input and output are taken as computational resources. The overall consumption of these resources is called *computational cost*. And, we can use this cost to compare the efficiency of techniques and choose the best one for our goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are the arguments? Firstly, iterating over huge datasets recorded at ATLAS requires a great amount of computational resources. While humans spend a lot of time and energy, neural networks are designed to be efficient at repeatability. Hence, NNs offer a significantly lower computational cost than manual analysis when iterating over thousands of events. Secondly, NNs can achieve a higher degree of optimization than manual selection cuts and often even go beyond the humanly obvious to find correlations between data points that increase the accuracy of classification. The caveat is that these are *black box algorithms*. They are not completely transparent, which makes their decision-making process inaccessible.

    "Imagine that you are hiking in a foggy mountainscape. You got tired and now want to get down the valley where all close-by cities are located. As you descend to higher pressure levels, the fog increases and the range of your field of view consequently decreases. To avoid any potential obstacles or dangerous pitfalls, you stop and carefully scout the terrain as far down as your field of view can reach. Hence, the distance you cover between stepping and scouting reduces as your field of view decreases in range. However, this slower pace is a good indicator since it implies you are getting closer to the city! Essentially, you are guided to lower your altitude by the decrease in the distance covered per interval of stepping and scouting. You might not reach a city at sea-level (e.g. Stockholm) but you surely will achieve your goal of finding a city in a valley (e.g. Zermatt). \n",

    "Similarly to how you hiked an imaginary mountainscape by following the fog, a neural network finds a *local minima* (valley) of a function through a *gradient descent*. This function should not be confused with the neural network function we discussed in the previous section. It numerically evaluates the overall performance of the modelled neural network function in accomplishing classification. High values of the function indicate a poor performance whereas low values, a good one. Therefore, we call it the *loss function*. Back to our analogy, the loss function can be thought of as the shape of the terrain and its values as the hiker’s altitude, which tells us how far down we still have to go. The number of axes (dimensions) of this function is equal to the number of inputs it takes. For example, our cats and dogs classifier from the previous section has a 3-dimensional loss function since it takes three different descriptors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the same logic, gradient descent is analogous to the whole process of hiking down the mountain and it is related to the steepness of the loss function. In more technical terms, it is the iterative process of calculating the current value of the loss function (scouting) and then altering the inner parameters of the NN by a step down in the loss function (stepping). The NN repeats this process through multiple iterations, each time decreasing the step size (field of view decreases) until it reaches a model optimized for successfully classifying signal and background events (a city is reached). \n",

    "In the animation below, the black dot represents the position of a neural network as it descends along the gradient by a definite step size.

You can imagine this threshold to be something akin to the difference between understanding and memorizing how to solve a particular set of questions. At first, you might just get the overall idea but still incorrectly answer the majority of questions (underfitting). With more practice, you may reach a point where you are comfortable with the content and can correctly answer most of the questions (good fitting). Here is where you should stop, congratulate yourself, and move onto another fresh set of practice questions. If you keep practicing even further with the same set, however, then you might memorize the answers and end up not getting a grasp of their reasoning at all (overfitting). \n",

    "In more scientific terms, the accuracy of the neural network greatly decreases when it is overfitting. Although the network still seems to yield good results for the training set, it becomes evidently poor in accuracy when it tries to model new datasets. You can see an example of the three fitting scenarios previously discussed in the diagram below.\n",

    "Functions are one of the key principles of Mathematics. You can think of them as a machine that takes some input and processes it into an output. If $f$ is a function, with $X$ its domain (inputs) and $Y$ its range (outputs) such that $f:X \\rightarrow Y$. Below you can see a diagram showing links between inputs and outputs allowed by a function. Can you guess the algebraic notation of this function? Because of this general definition, there is a broad scope of actions that can be categorized as functions!\n",

    "\n",
    "We can observe a similar theorem in human society. A child learns virtually any language that is consistently around them. According to what they experience, each child will acquire a mother tongue. However, no one will ever speak nor write in the same exact way. The very concept of an ideal version of a language is intuitively strange to us. Since we observe several different vocabularies and pronunciations, we render our communication as an unique and approximate expression of a shared language framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network works in a similar manner. It will never model a function exactly but it will reach an unique approximation of a function, such as our imaginary network of friends. Be it predicting the existence of planetary bodies from astronomical observations, modelling the structure of a vital protein molecule from chemical data, or probing invisible dark matter from ATLAS Open Data, neural networks can tackle the challenge! That does not mean we will ever find such a model but at least we know they could theoretically do so if given enough computational resources. It is for this reason these algorithms are so ubiquitous in the modern world. More than a pile of mathematics and computations, neural networks are a key tool for human progress in Science.\n",
