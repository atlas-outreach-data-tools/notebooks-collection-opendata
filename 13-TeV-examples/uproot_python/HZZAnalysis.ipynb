    "    the Higgs boson was finally discovered in 2012 by CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN.\n",

    "1. **Cuts** - we need to account for lepton selection rules in the event.\n",
    "In the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931200857X),\n",
    "    it is stated that we must\n",
    "\"[select] two pairs of isolated leptons, each of which is comprised of two leptons with the **same flavour** and **opposite charge**\".\n",
    "The datasets used in this notebook have already been filtered to include at least 4 leptons per event.\n",
    "We need to filter the data such that in each event, there are pairs of leptons of the **same lepton type** (`lep_type`) and summing to **zero lepton charge** (`lep_charge`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mass calculation** - the data to be plotted is the 4-lepton invariant mass, which can be found using the equation: $$m_\\text{4l} = \\sqrt{E^2_\\text{tot}-\\mathbf{p}_\\text{tot}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_\\text{tot}}$$\n",
    "in units where $c=1$.\n",
    "$E_\\text{tot}$ is the total energy and $\\mathbf{p}_\\text{tot}$ is the total momentum.\n",
    "This calculation is performed using the vector array method `.M` on the sum of lepton 4-momenta (`lep_pt`,`lep_eta`,`lep_phi`,`lep_E`).\n",
    "\n",
    "From this,\n",
    "    we can see why we chose those six important variables earlier.\n",
    "The physical reasoning for why we perform these steps is encapsulated in the idea of **conservation laws**.\n",

If no weights are assigned to the events this (i.e. the weights are all set to 1) $\\sum_i w_i$ simply gives the total number of simulated events.
