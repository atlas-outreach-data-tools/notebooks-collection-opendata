    "### What are Non-collision Backgrounds?\n",
    "\n",
    "ATLAS is built to study collisions between protons (and between heavy ions) that happen right in the center of the detector. It does that by carefully measuring all the particles that come flying out of each collision, like a camera. That also leaves it sensitive to a variety of other things that can happen, which are generally described as \"Non-collision backgrounds\". The most common examples of non-collision backgrounds are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray). These are usually muons that come from the upper atmosphere and fly through the detector (they also fly through *you*, as you're sitting there, all the time). They look just like muons that come from collisions, except they usually come at funny angles (because they aren't passing straight through the center of the detector), and they often come at strange times (they can arrive when the collider has no protons in it! They can also come *between* bunches of protons).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detector noise. Just like static on a radio, the electronics in our detector sometimes have noise. Usually these look different from the signals we are looking for (just like you can tell the difference between static on your radio and music). Sometimes the static is so loud we can't hear the music any more, and then the data have to be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Beam halo. As the protons fly around the ring of the LHC in bunches, there are [collimators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimator) that block any protons that get too far out of a normal orbit. Those protons don't just stop; they can produce sprays of particles that run parallel to the original proton beam and sometimes find their way into the detector. They usually come at funny angles, and move across the detector from one side to the other, rather than coming out of the center like particles from a collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Beam gas. The proton bunches go around the LHC in a beam pipe that is *nearly* a vacuum, but it's not perfect. Sometimes there can be collisions between protons from the beam and stray atoms of gas in the beam pipe. They tend to be very asymmetric-looking (because the gas is drifting slowly, and the beam is running full-speed into it), and they tend to be off-center (because the gas can be anywhere in the beam pipe, not only in the very center)."

    "One give-away that something has gone wrong in an event (that a non-collision background or some other data quality issue is present) is a large amount of missing transverse momentum. In the LHC, the proton beams collide head-on. Because of momentum conservation, if there are particles that fly out in one direction (up, for example), some particles have to fly out in the opposite direction (down, in that example). An imbalance in the momentum in the collision might be an indication of detector signals that aren't coming from a collision. Let's select events with no leptons (for the more advanced student: this will help remove Standard Model events that often have missing transverse momentum from neutrinos, like the decays of W bosons into a lepton and a neutrino), at least one jet above 150 GeV, and at least 100 GeV of missing transverse momentum."

    "A great success! Now, what does the plot mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're showing here is the angle of the highest transverse momentum jet in the event. The detector is designed to be symmetrical, like a can. The proton collisions don't know which way is up. So, if there are no detector issues and no non-collision backgrounds, this should be a perfectly flat distribution. It's not!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some small bumps that you can see around -2.5 to -0.5, and 0.5 to 2.5. Those are generally because some parts of the detector had problems. In this case, they weren't severe enough problems that we removed the data, but if a particular data analysis is very sensitive, it might have to apply corrections to fix those issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see two *big* excesses at 0 and pi (the edges of the histogram). Those are because of non-collision backgrounds! The way the collimators are arranged, the shielding of the detector, and even the physical structures supporting it (which are often made of steel) block more of the non-collision background at some angles than at others, and those bumps show areas where there's additional background created that doesn't get blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some data analyses, this is very dangerous! For example, if someone is searching for new physics that leaves a signal in the detector like a high-momentum jet and missing transverse momentum (that's what dark matter would look like in our detector!), then they need to be able to cut down on the amount of non-collision background. We have various tricks to do that (some of which are called \"jet cleaning\", because they are built to identify jets that have particularly funny properties in the detector) that the most sensitive analyses have to carefully apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to play around with the jet transverse momentum and missing transverse momentum cuts to see how you can enhance the non-collision background in the plot. If you don't require any missing transverse momentum, the background is totally invisible!",
