In the ATLAS Open Data, metadata includes things like a unique numerical dataset identifier, the production cross section, and the description of the physics processes included in the sample. These metadata must be used to properly normalize the MC simulation datasets when comparing to detector data, and they can also be used to search for relevant or related samples.\n",
