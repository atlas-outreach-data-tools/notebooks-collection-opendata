    "## The decay into two photons\n",
    "\n",
    "The Higgs boson has an extremely brief lifetime, approximately $10^{-22} \\,\\text{s}$. It decays almost immediately after it is produced, making direct detection of the particle impossible. However, by using the Standard Model, we can predict the various decay products of the Higgs, such as photons, Z bosons, quarks, and others, each occurring with different probabilities. These **decay channels** help us identify the presence of the Higgs boson. In this notebook, we will focus on analyzing one specific decay channel: $H \\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$\n",

    "<CENTER><img src=\"../uproot_python/images/feynman_diagrams/Hyy_feynman.png\" style=\"width:40%\"></CENTER>\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to this as our desired **signal**. Ideally, we aim to identify collisions that produce two photons, which would indicate the presence of a Higgs boson. However, along with our signal, many photons detected do not originate from Higgs boson decay but rather from other processes, forming the **background**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backgrounds are classified into two categories: reducible and irreducible. **Reducible backgrounds** can be significantly minimized using experimental techniques such as data cuts, particle identification, and isolation criteria. For instance, in our case, a reducible background might involve events where a jet is misidentified as a photon. By applying stricter criteria to ensure that the detected particles are indeed photons (and not misidentified jets), this background can be reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, irreducible backgrounds cannot be easily distinguished from the signal because they involve the same final states or processes that the signal would produce. In the scenario of Higgs decay into two photons, an **irreducible background** would be the direct production of two photons from other Standard Model processes, such as quark-antiquark annihilation. These events are fundamentally indistinguishable from the signal events based on final state particles alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "To address this, we can consider the total invariant mass of the photon products. By conservation of energy and momentum, the invariant mass of the products must equal the Higgs mass, whereas other background processes will have different invariant masses. The final step is to plot the invariant mass of each event and identify the peak around 125 GeV, which corresponds to the mass of the Higgs boson.\n",
